Autonomy: defines model evaluation frameworks, influences team decisions on model refresh cycles and error budgets.
Criterion Weight Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Level 5
Model Selection and Justification 0.33 Says 'I used ARIMA' without explaining why it fits the data or what assumptions were made. Recalls ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or Prophet but doesn't explain why one is better than others. Explains when to use ARIMA vs. Prophet, citing data stationarity and trend structure as reasons. Compares ARIMA, Prophet, and N-BEATS, justifying selection based on data gaps, seasonality, and computational constraints. Analyzes model selection through cross-validation, bias-variance trade-offs, and real-world data edge cases (e.g., missing values, sudden shifts) and recommends a hybrid approach with fallback models.
Failure Mode and Edge Case Reasoning 0.33 Says 'it works in the lab' without discussing data drift or concept drift. Mentions data gaps or outliers but doesn't explain how they affect model performance. Describes how sudden changes (e.g., product launch) can break a time series model and how to detect them. Details specific edge cases: non-stationary data, non-linear trends, and how to detect and handle them with changepoint analysis or online learning. Anticipates and plans for edge cases like data corruption, sensor drift, or abrupt seasonality shifts and designs monitoring and alerting systems to catch them early.
Evaluation and Model Monitoring 0.33 Says 'it's accurate' without defining error metrics or how they're updated. Uses MAE or RMSE but doesn't explain how it's computed or what it means in context. Explains using out-of-sample validation, time splits, and error metrics to assess forecast quality. Describes a monitoring dashboard that tracks MAE, RMSE, and forecast errors over time and alerts on divergence. Designs a proactive model health system with drift detection, confidence intervals, and automated retraining triggers based on performance degradation.

Data Modeling & Analysis

Band 10+ • Minimum passing score 3.8
10+

Verbal-only signals: discusses schema evolution, data lineage, and cross-service impact; uses real-world data governance decisions.

Scope: org-wide data strategy, including data mesh, schema governance, and analytics infrastructure alignment.

Autonomy: proposes data ownership models, defines data policies, and influences platform-wide data decisions.
Criterion Weight Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Level 5
Schema Design & Evolution Strategy 0.33 Describes a schema as a static document; no process for versioning or deprecation. Recalls a schema version used in a past project but does not explain how it evolved or how changes were communicated. Explains a schema design with clear versioning (e.g., schema registry), and describes how backward compatibility is maintained during transitions. Details a schema evolution plan including data migration, monitoring for backward compatibility, and stakeholder communication during transitions. Proposes a data schema governance model with automated schema diffing, versioned lineage tracking, and a process for handling schema drift across services.
Data Trade-off Analysis in Analysis Pipelines 0.33 Says 'we use a simple join' without explaining when or why this is appropriate or suboptimal. States that a pipeline uses a flat table for performance but does not discuss memory, latency, or data duplication trade-offs. Analyzes a pipeline trade-off between latency and completeness, e.g., real-time vs batch, and justifies the choice with concrete metrics. Compares multiple data pipeline designs (e.g., streaming vs batch) and evaluates cost, error rates, and operational overhead under different workloads. Anticipates failure modes in a data pipeline (e.g., schema drift, missing data) and proposes a resilient design with fallbacks, validation, and real-time monitoring.
Edge Case Reasoning in Data Analysis 0.33 Does not address missing or malformed data; justifies a result without considering data quality. Mentions 'we had a null value' but does not explain how it was handled or what impact it had on downstream analysis. Discusses how nulls and outliers were handled using specific techniques (e.g., imputation, capping) and justifies the choice based on domain knowledge. Walks through a real-world edge case (e.g., timestamp overflow) and explains how it was identified, modeled, and mitigated in the data flow. Anticipates and designs for edge cases like time-zone mismatches, timezone-aware joins, and data from multiple sources with inconsistent formats.

Python & Data Science Libraries

Band 10+ • Minimum passing score 3.8
10+

Verbal-only signals: 'I designed a library that abstracts cross-team data workflows', 'I evaluated trade-offs in choosing between pandas and polars for a production pipeline'

Scope: Org/system-level library design with influence on data science and ML engineering practices

Autonomy: Owns decision-making around library APIs, performance, and integration with downstream tools
Criterion Weight Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Level 5
Library Design & API Abstraction 0.33 Gives a vague description of what the library does without explaining how it solves a real problem or what constraints shaped the design. Recalls a basic API with a few functions, such as 'load', 'transform', and 'save', without explaining design decisions or edge cases. Describes a library that abstracts a common data workflow, e.g., preprocessing for ML, with clear inputs/outputs and defines when to use it over raw libraries like pandas. Explains how the API balances usability and performance, e.g., using lazy evaluation or batching, and discusses trade-offs like memory usage vs. speed. Precisely defines the API with explicit edge cases (e.g., empty datasets, large memory usage), anticipates failure modes (e.g., OOM), and justifies design choices based on real-world data pipeline constraints.
Performance & Memory Trade-offs in Data Processing 0.33 Says 'it's fast' without explaining what metrics or conditions make it fast. Mentions 'pandas is slow for large datasets' but doesn't explain why or what alternatives exist. Explains that using Dask or Polars reduces memory pressure and enables processing 10M+ rows without OOM, and compares the performance of different backends. Details a real-world trade-off between CPU time and memory usage, e.g., using a streaming approach vs. batch, and justifies which is better for a given data size and latency requirement. Quantifies performance gains (e.g., 3x faster with 40% less memory) and explains how this was measured, including profiling tools and real-world data sizes, and anticipates when the gain might not hold.
Edge Case Reasoning & Fail-Safe Design 0.33 Doesn't address what happens when input is malformed or missing. Says 'we handle errors' without specifying how, e.g., using try-catch in a function. Describes handling of nulls, malformed JSON, or inconsistent data formats with specific error paths and fallbacks, e.g., using a schema validator. Walks through a complex edge case (e.g., circular references in a nested data structure) and explains how the library detects and prevents crashes through early validation and type guards. Anticipates and documents failure modes like infinite loops, recursion limits, or data corruption, and includes explicit safeguards (e.g., timeouts, resource limits, logging) with real-world examples from past systems.

Criterion Weight Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Level 5
Data Model Design & Schema Evolution 0.33 Describes tables with no relationships or constraints, says 'we'll figure it out later' Recalls tables and primary keys, but no schema versioning or change history Explains key relationships (e.g., user -> session) and how schema evolves with versioned migrations Details trade-offs between normalization and denormalization for performance vs. query complexity, with examples from real systems Anticipates schema drift in distributed systems and proposes a schema governance model with audit trails and rollback paths
Pipeline Resilience & Error Handling 0.33 Says 'we just send it and hope it works' without error recovery mechanisms Mentions retry on failure but doesn't define backoff strategies or failure thresholds Explains how a pipeline handles failed records (e.g., dead letter queue) and retry policies based on error type Compares batch vs. streaming failure handling, including backpressure and circuit breakers in real-world systems Designs a fault-tolerant pipeline with idempotency, bounded retry windows, and real-time monitoring for error bursts
Cross-Service Data Consistency & Synchronization 0.33 Says data is 'consistent' without explaining how or when it's synchronized States that data is synced via a 'central database' with no explanation of conflicts or propagation Explains conflict resolution strategies (e.g., last-write-wins, merge) and how they're applied across services Discusses trade-offs between eventual consistency and strong consistency in distributed systems, with examples from real-world systems Proposes a data sync framework with version vectors, conflict detection, and audit logging for all changes

Business Insight Communication

Band 10+ • Minimum passing score 3.8
10+

Verbal-only signals: 'I helped shape the product roadmap based on market data,' 'I identified a hidden cost in customer churn that no one else saw,' 'I reframed the problem to align with business KPIs.'

Scope: Cross-functional influence, strategic alignment, impact on org-wide decisions, systemic understanding of business drivers.

Autonomy: Can independently diagnose business issues, propose systemic solutions, and influence long-term strategy without direct supervision.
Criterion Weight Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Level 5
Translating Business Problems into Technical Actionable Hypotheses 0.33 Says 'we need to improve performance' without defining what performance means or why it matters to business outcomes. Recalls a metric like 'customer retention' and says 'we should improve that' without explaining how or why it's tied to revenue or operations. Describes a specific business problem, e.g., 'we're losing 15% of customers in Q3,' and frames it as a hypothesis: 'If we reduce onboarding friction by 30%, we can reduce churn by 10%.' Provides a data point and a plausible causal link. Clearly defines a hypothesis with measurable KPIs, explains the trade-offs (e.g., faster onboarding may increase support load), and suggests a small-scale test (e.g., A/B with 500 users) to validate it. Anticipates edge cases (e.g., churn spike during new product launch), models counterfactuals, and proposes a multi-dimensional test plan (e.g., test on different user segments, with and without feature X) to validate or invalidate the hypothesis before investing in full-scale changes.
Communicating Trade-offs Across Stakeholders 0.33 Says 'we should do X' without mentioning alternatives or implications. Lists features to add, e.g., 'add analytics dashboard,' without explaining cost, time, or impact on other teams. Explains two options, e.g., 'we can improve reporting with a new tool or enhance existing one,' and compares them in terms of cost, speed, and data quality, with a clear recommendation based on context. Articulates trade-offs in terms of time, risk, and resource allocation, e.g., 'adding real-time dashboards increases latency by 20% and requires 2x engineering effort; we'd need to prioritize based on which KPIs are most time-sensitive.' Anticipates unintended consequences (e.g., new dashboard may overload legacy systems), proposes a phased rollout with monitoring, and includes fallback plans (e.g., revert if latency exceeds threshold).
Anticipating Edge Cases and Systemic Risks in Business Decisions 0.33 Doesn't consider exceptions or rare events; assumes all customers behave the same way. Mentions 'edge cases' as a vague concern, without examples or concrete scenarios. Gives a specific example: 'We didn’t account for users with low bandwidth; we assumed all users have stable internet.' Explains how this could break a feature in practice. Uses real-world data to identify a rare but impactful scenario (e.g., 'we saw a 10% spike in support tickets during a regional outage'), and proposes a mitigation (e.g., 'add regional failover in the product design'). Proactively models systemic failure modes (e.g., 'if our pricing model changes, it could affect partner revenue'), and designs a scenario-based review process to validate business assumptions before launch.
